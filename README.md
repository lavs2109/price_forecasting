Price Forecasting
Welcome to the Price Forecasting project! This repository contains code and resources for predicting future prices using time series data and machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide a flexible and scalable framework for forecasting prices of various assets, such as stocks, commodities, or other financial instruments.


Overview
This project implements a price forecasting system leveraging historical data and advanced predictive models. It supports multiple forecasting methods, including statistical models (e.g., ARIMA) and machine learning approaches (e.g., LSTM, LightGBM). The system is designed to be modular, allowing users to experiment with different datasets and algorithms.

Features
Preprocessing of time series data (e.g., handling missing values, normalization).
Implementation of multiple forecasting models:
ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory neural networks)
Gradient Boosting (e.g., LightGBM)
Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Visualization tools for analyzing historical trends and forecast results.
Scalable design for handling large datasets.
Requirements
To run this project, you’ll need the following:

Python 3.8 or higher
Libraries:
pandas - Data manipulation and analysis
numpy - Numerical computations
scikit-learn - Machine learning utilities
tensorflow or pytorch - Deep learning frameworks (for LSTM)

python main.py --data path/to/your/data.csv --model lstm
Available command-line arguments:
--data: Path to the input dataset (CSV format).
--model: Model type (arima, lstm, lightgbm).
--horizon: Forecasting horizon (e.g., 10 days ahead).
--output: Directory to save results (default: ./output).

Copy
python main.py --data data/stock_prices.csv --model lstm --horizon 10 --output results/
View the results in the output/ directory, including forecasts and visualizations.
Dataset
The project expects a CSV file with at least the following columns:

date: Date of the observation (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
price: Target variable to forecast (e.g., closing price).
Example dataset (data/sample_data.csv):
